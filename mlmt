fdelt is related linearly with x. (confirmed)


fdelt vs qratio


















relating fDelt with q

1> the cause of plateau.
ques: in the histogram plot( check them in main(branch) > metadata > 24_05 ) of fDelt there exist a plateau on the opposite side of the position. 
for negative position there exist a plateau on the positive side. there is no plateau when particle is placed at 0 position. thies result in bais data.

possible explaination > the plateau exists when particle is placed on any other position except zero this may be due to existence of more positionon one side. for ex when 
particle is placed at +20 the right side would have (+30,+40,+45) while the other side would have (+10,0,-20,-30,-40,-45). 

sol > 1.) making no difference between positive and negative values. check main(branch) > metadata > 24_05 the histgram of positive and negative values of +20, -20
they make a perfect gaussian. hence use data of both values. the positive and negative values can be decided right at the moment usinf
a > which plate got more charge 

2>implication of charge why is it needed?. is charge lost aur gained during this


3>importance of tnear or t far //no need, if relative cannot use time stamp till
// non recgnised relation between ftsamp

4> x3 x9 x15 the equation between fDelt mean and position


5> using 20 percent  of certain position

6>using training data right at the moment  
need guidance

7>taking no difference between positive and negative dist
will do 

8>give position with certain other values like x ray
// that is move the scitillator to another poistion to get something.
//need for additional data files.
//will do nothing to find
//mett woth Dutta to discuss
